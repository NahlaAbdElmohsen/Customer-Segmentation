# Customer-Segmentation
This is a Machine Learning project about customer transactions.
# Introduction
This project contain information about customers and the transactions they made and contains machine learning model to determine the active segment of customers and how to improve loyalty and satisfaction.
# Dataset Description
### where did the data come from?
E-commerce dataset provided by the instructor. 
### How large is this dataset?
The dataset contains 5 sheets with data about 5000 record.
### What steps were taken in this project?
**1.Explore the data**

**2.Cleaning the data:** handing missing value,duplicates,..etc

**3.EDA:** making approprite visualization to explore important features and trends

**4.Data preprocessing:** to make sure that model will get reliable results

**5.Model training and Evaluation:** trian the model and evaluate its accuracy to find the appropriate segment

# Analysis goals
To precisely determine which segment we will offer more coupons to increase satisfaction and loyalty.
# Results and insights
We use **K-means** model twice with two differnt features to explore different segments and appropriately determine the correct one.

**note:** the file was updated and use feature engineering to add new features to use in the model.

this is my first time doing this.So that, sorry for any mistakes:)
